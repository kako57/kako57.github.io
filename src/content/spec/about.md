## CTFs

Outside of school, I enjoy playing CTFs (Capture The Flag).
I play for [UofTCTF](https://uoftctf.org) and [L3ak](https://l3ak.team).
I mainly focus on reverse engineering and binary exploitation challenges,
but I also enjoy playing around sandbox escapes, system exploitation,
and other miscellaneous challenges. I authored a few writeups for CTF challenges I've solved,
which can be found in this site.

As part of UofTCTF, I have exploited a set of vulnerabilities we discovered in PCRS,
which is a system used to serve programming exercises to students at the University of Toronto.
We found multiple ways to escape from the sandboxing of the code execution environment,
and were able to achieve remote code execution on the host machine.
The vulnerablities we found were later assigned as [CVE-2023-46404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-46404).

Over the last three years, I have also authored a few CTF challenges, for both UofTCTF and L3AK CTF:
- [UofTCTF 2023 - Lift Day](https://github.com/UofTCTF/uoftctf-2023/tree/master/Reverse%20Engineering/Lift%20Day)
- [UoftCTF 2024 - All binary exploitation challenges](https://github.com/UofTCTF/uoftctf-2024-chals-public/tree/master/Binary%20Exploitation)
- [L3AK CTF 2024 - chonccfile](https://github.com/L3AK-TEAM/L3akCTF-2024-public/tree/main/pwn/chonccfile) / [writeup by dandb3](https://velog.io/@dandb3/L3ak-CTF-writeup#4-chonccfile)
- [L3AK CTF 2025 - cosmofile](https://github.com/L3AK-TEAM/L3akCTF-2025-public/tree/main/pwn/cosmofile) / [writeup by razvan](https://razvan.sh/writeups/cosmofile-l3akctf/)

I have also been playing with \[:\], which is a big team that focuses on
playing big and hard CTFs such as PlaidCTF and DEF CON CTF.
I mainly contribute by making tools and scripts to help with reverse engineering.

## Hacking at work

I interned at [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com) in the winter and summer of 2024,
and the winter of 2025. A notable achievement I had while working there was finding a zero-day vulnerability
in NVIDIA Container Toolkit, later assigned [CVE-2025-23359](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5616),
also known as [ZDI-25-087 / ZDI-CAN-26525](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-25-087/)

Aside from my discovery of a zero-day, I have authored functional proof of concepts and reports for other vulnerabilities:
- [CVE-2024-1071](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1071)
- [CVE-2024-0132](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0132)
- [CVE-2024-0133](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0133)
- [CVE-2024-0134](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0134)
