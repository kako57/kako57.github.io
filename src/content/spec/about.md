# About

Hello! I'm Dre.

also known as:

- dre (real life)
- kako57 (github)
- drec (ctfs)
- dre.cc (discord)

I'm currently a fourth year student at the University of Toronto,
with a major in Mental Health Studies and a minor in Biology and Computer Science.

Outside of school, I enjoy playing CTFs (Capture The Flag).
I play for [UofTCTF](https://uoftctf.org) and [L3AK](https://l3ak.team).
I mainly focus on reverse engineering and binary exploitation challenges.

I interned at [Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com) in the winter and summer of 2024,
and the winter of 2025. A notable achievement I had while working there was finding a zero-day vulnerability
in NVIDIA Container Toolkit, later assigned [CVE-2025-23359](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5616).
